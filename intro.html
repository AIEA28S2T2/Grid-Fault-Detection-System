    <h1>Introduction</h1>

        <ul>
            <li>Fault detection in power supply systems is crucial to ensure continuous and reliable electricity delivery. Modern techniques like machine learning are increasingly being used for this purpose.</li>
            <li>Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest are some popular machine learning algorithms that can help detect faults in power systems.</li>
            <li>These algorithms analyze data from the power system, such as voltage levels, current, and other parameters, to identify patterns that indicate potential faults. By classifying the normal and faulty conditions, these algorithms can quickly pinpoint issues, helping to prevent more serious damage and minimize downtime.</li>
            <li>SVM works by finding a decision boundary that best separates different types of faults from normal operation</li>

            <li>KNN, on the other hand, checks the fault condition by comparing the input data with a set of labeled training data and finding the nearest neighbors</li>
            <li>Random Forest uses multiple decision trees to make a more accurate prediction, offering the benefit of reducing overfitting.</li>
            <li>These techniques can be trained on historical data, allowing them to continuously improve and detect faults more accurately over time, providing an effective solution for fault detection in power supply systems.</li>
