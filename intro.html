    <h1>Introduction</h1>

        <ul>
            <li>Fault detection in power supply systems is crucial to ensure continuous and reliable electricity delivery. Modern techniques like machine learning are increasingly being used for this purpose.</li>
            <li>These algorithms analyze data from the power system, such as voltage levels, current, and other parameters, to identify patterns that indicate potential faults. By classifying the normal and faulty conditions, these algorithms can quickly pinpoint issues, helping to prevent more serious damage and minimize downtime.</li>
            <li>SVM works by finding a decision boundary that best separates different types of faults from normal operation</li>
            <li>Transmission networks are vulnerable to various types of faults, including symmetrical faults (LLL, LLLG) and unsymmetrical faults (LG, LL, LLG), Rapid and accurate fault identification is crucial for ensuring system protection and minimizing downtime.</li>
            <li>This study demonstrates that the proposed SVM-based fault classification approach is not only highly accurate and efficient but also suitable for real-time implementation in protective relays, ensuring enhanced fault diagnosis and improved power system reliability.</li>
