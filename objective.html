    <h1>Objective</h1>

        <ul>
            <li>The objective of using machine learning algorithms like Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest for fault detection in power supply systems is to improve the reliability, efficiency, and speed of identifying potential issues in the system</li>
            <li>By applying these algorithms, the goal is to quickly and accurately classify system conditions as either normal or faulty, which helps in preventing power outages and ensuring continuous power supply. </li>
            <li> These models aim to reduce human intervention and the time it takes to detect faults, ultimately minimizing system downtime and potential damage.</li>
            <li>Another key objective is to enhance the accuracy of fault detection by leveraging the strengths of each algorithm. For example, SVM helps with clear classification of normal and faulty conditions, KNN offers simplicity and speed for real-time detection, and Random Forest provides robust predictions by combining multiple decision trees.</li>
            <li>Together, these algorithms aim to handle complex data patterns, such as fluctuating voltage, current, or load conditions, and provide timely alerts to operators, ensuring safer and more reliable power supply operations.</li>
