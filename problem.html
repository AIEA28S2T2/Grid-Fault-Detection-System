    <h1>Problem Statement</h1>
    <div> Fault detection and classification in power transmission systems are essential for maintaining grid stability and preventing major power outages but there is struggle with slow response times, reduced accuracy in noisy environments, and limited capability in handling diverse fault conditions.</div>
    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <div>KNN based on fault detection and classification that it serve as input data for the developed models, enabling the detection and classification of power system faults using data from power frequency based on MATLAB simulated dataset.</div>
